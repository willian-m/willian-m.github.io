# A crash course on modern physics: II. Energy and momentum quantization

On the [last post](/_posts/2022-09-08-Charge-Quantization.md), we saw how
the matter of quantization of charge was settled. It was not a discovery per-se.
But rather, a confirmation of a suspicion that was present since Faraday's 
experiments on electrolysis. On another, no one suspected that energy and 
momentum were transferred in discrete packs. This post will review how this
was discovered. The books on which I based this post off are the same as in
the last post, but I list them bellow for completeness
