title:  "Welcome to My Website"

Welcome! My name is Willian and I am a High-Energy-Physics post-doc, currently working at 
University of Campinas (UNICAMP), in Brazil. More specifically, I am working with simulations
of Ultra-Relativistic Collisions of Heavy-Ions. 

Everyone that works with computers learns things along the way that were not formally taught. And 
many things you do only once each blue moon and when you will do them again, you just forgot. Thus,
it is relatively common for people to gather these knowledge into a site for easy referencing later 
and, with some luck, help someone else who is stuck at the same problem. So, this is one of the goals 
of this site. And since I am physicist, of course I may include in my list of tricks, some math and
physics tricks as well. In fact, I may expand my posts to whatever subject I see fit.

In addition to the purpose above, this site will doubles as a place for me to keep my CV on-line, publication list, travel photos and other related things.

Below is the list of my posts. I hope you enjoy reading them (and I hope you find them useful!).
